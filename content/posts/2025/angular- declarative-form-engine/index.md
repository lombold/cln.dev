# Motivation
* Forms are crucial. event more important in business applications
* business applications have complex forms and a lot of them
* implementaion should be easy and standardized
* angular already decouples the form definition from the rendering via reactive forms
  * which can simplify the reuse of form logic such as validation, value changes, etc
* we can go further and make the rendering more declarative. by rendering the form's fields dynamically based on the form definition
* **the goal is** 
  * to define in your application a set of supported form fields 
  * render this fields based on a form definition

# The dynamic form field

# The dynamic form

# Example usage

# Conclusion
if forms are the heart of your application and are they very conistent? => use a declarative form engine. build your own of use mine: `npm i @lombold/angular-form-engine`
